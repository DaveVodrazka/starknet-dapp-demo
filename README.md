# Starknet dApp Demo

This project is a starting point for a workshop on how to build a dApp on Starknet.

### Get Started

Run the following command to install dependencies:

```console
npm install
```

Run in development mode with

```console
npm run dev
```

Now go to [http://localhost:3000/](http://localhost:3000/). If you see a website with Starknet logo and name, all is working as intended, happy hacking!

### Final dApp

This project has two branches: _master_ and _final_. Master branch holds the starter project, but if you want to check out the final project you can find it in the _final_ branch.
