# Starknet dApp Demo

This project is a starting point for a workshop on how to build a dApp on Starknet.

### Get Started

Run the following command to install dependencies:

```console
npm install
```

Run in development mode with

```console
npm run dev
```

You should see _localhost_ address, where the app is running, in your terminal. _Ctrl + click_ the link or copy/paste it into your browser.

If you see a website with Starknet logo and name all is working as intended, happy hacking!

### Final dApp

This project has two branches: _master_ and _final_. Master branch holds the starter project, but if you want to check out the final project you can find it in the _final_ branch.
